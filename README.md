# Pewlett-Hackard_Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to help Pewlett Hackard prepare for an upcoming wave of employees getting ready to retire. Since thousands of positions will need to be filled following this retirement wave, it is important to understand who will be retiring and what/how many positions will need to be filled. The module 7 challenge specifically aims to, "determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program".
